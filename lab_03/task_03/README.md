# Task 3: (50 Points)

Draw an activity diagram to describe a student registering a class at a
university using the "search for class" function. The diagram should have at
least two swim lanes (student and university system) and describe the following
process:

1. A student opens a browser and visits the university.edu website.
2. Then student chooses the “my classes” option in the website.
3. Then the student searches the desired classes by entering the desired subject
   code or by clicking the "select subject" button to choose from a list.
4. In the returned list from the search or from the list, the student finds the
   class to add and click the select class button.
    - If the list does not contain the required class, the student revises the
      search option.
    - If the correct class is found, the student reviews the information and
      then submits the selected class.
5. The student considers the class is added to the schedule ONLY when a GREEN
   CHECK in the "Status" column is shown. If the student sees a RED X, then the
   student makes appropriate adjustments and resubmits for success addition of
   the class to the student’s schedule.
