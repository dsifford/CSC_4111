# Question 2: (25 points)

Consider to build a management system for a startup software company.

-   There is a base class `Employee` (which has `name`, `birthday`, `address`,
    `gender`, and a method `printContactDetails()`).
-   Then 2 classes inherit the `Employee` class:
    1. First is `FullTimeEmployee`, which has a new fields called `salary`,
       `bonus`, and new methods called `printMonthlySalary()` and
       `printEmployeeDetails()`.
    2. The other class is `PartTimeEmployee`, which contains new fields
       `workingHours`, `hourlySalary`, and `partialBonus`, with new methods
       `calculateMonthlySalary()` and `calculatePartialBonus()`.

Design and develop appropriate classes or interfaces, and each class member's
data type (i.e. field or method) i.e., provide each field's data type and each
method's return type. Then draw the complete class diagram of this design.
