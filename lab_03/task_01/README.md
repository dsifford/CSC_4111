# Question 1: (25 points)

Now extend the given diagram. The `Professor` class aggregates a `Bonus` class,
which has fields named `bonusPerYear (Dollars)`, `baseSalary (Dollars)`,
`extraWorkingHours (int)` and a method called `calculateBonus (return Dollars)`.
A class `ForeignExchangeStudent` inherits the class `Student` with new fields
`country (String)`, `availabilityHours (int)` and a method
`scheduleFinal(return String)`. Revise the class `Professor` based on the
`Bonus` class (hint: change related fields) and draw the complete new class
diagram including the class `Dollars` (no need to specify the fields and methods
of `Dollars` class).
