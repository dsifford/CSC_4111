# Part 1 Calculator GUI (80 points)

Develop a working calculator GUI application in Windows with Qt framework and
using the Visual Studio 2017 develop environment and the CMake build utility.
Use `QtHelloWorld` project as your base.

The following are the requirements you shall meet in your calculator:

## GUI Requirements

-   [x] The calculator shall have a functional buttons for numbers from 0 to 9,
        and point (.) (5 points)
-   [x] The calculator shall have functional buttons for addition (`+`),
        subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), division (`/`) , square root
        (`√`), equal (`=`), and clear (to clean the previous inputs and results)
        operations. (10 points)
-   [x] The calculator shall have two editable input fields for the operands of
        the operations listed in #2 and one result output field that is not
        editable. (2 Points)
-   [x] The buttons and inputs shall have appropriate text labels. (2 Points)
-   [x] The title bar of the calculator window shall have the following title:
        `Derek Sifford's Calculator`. (1 Point)

## Operations Requirements

-   [x] Implement seven operations in the calculator: addition (`+`),
        subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), division (`/`) , square root
        (`√`), equal (`=`), and clear function in the calculator to clean the
        previous results. (50 points, 10 points each).
-   [x] All operators should be supported by both buttons on the program and the
        keyboard (5 points)
-   [ ] Calculator GUI shall be developed in Windows with Qt framework and
        Visual Studio 2017. Use QtHelloWorld project as your base. (5 points)

# Part 2 Short Documentation (20 points)

Write a brief report for Part 1 and explain how to use your program using clear
instructions and what you have learned from Qt programming that will help you
write future GUI programs.

Delete the folder for binaries (`/bin`, or another name when you use CMake to
create) from the project. Just keep the source code, related resources (e.g.
`*.ui`) and the correct `CMakeLists.txt`.

To turn in your assignment, place the source code folder and your report (from
part 2) into a zipped folder called `YourLastName_Lab4.zip`. Only the top folder
should be zipped. Then upload it to canvas. Download it yourself to make sure it
was uploaded correctly. If your file is not uploaded correctly, you may be
subject to the late policy.
