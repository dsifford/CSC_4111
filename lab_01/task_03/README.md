# Assignment Task 3 â€“ 20 points

Download and open `ANote` project, then build it.

There are compilation errors. Fix them. Once you solve the bug of `ANote`, you
should see the project running in the notification area of the taskbar during
debugging, as shown below:

Answer how to fix those errors (e.g. which files need to change, the
deleted/modified/added code, etc.) in a text file, then put it in a folder named
`Task3`. **Do NOT submit the project/program.**

Place all 3 folders into a zipped folder called
`YourLastName_YourFirstNameLab1.zip` and submit in.

Only the top folder should be zipped. Upload it to blackboard, then download it
yourself to ensure the submission is correct. If your submission is not uploaded
correctly, it will be subject to the late policy.
