# Assignment Task 1 - 50 points

Write a C++ class (or a set of classes) that implements a stack using a double
linked list. The type of data contained in the stack should be `int`. The
maximum size of the stack is 50. Implement the following methods:

-   Constructor and destructor. (5 points)
-   `void push(int value)` -> pushes an element with the value into the stack.
    (5 points)
-   `int pop()` -> pops an element from the stack and returns its value. (10
    points)
-   `int isEmpty()` -> returns 1 if the stack is empty, 0 otherwise. (5 points)
-   `int numOfElements()` -> returns the number of elements in the stack. (5
    points)
-   `void printElements()` -> print out the current stack to the console. (5
    points)
-   A `main` function -> execute each method of your stack (except the
    destructor) at least once without asking input from the users. (15 points)

**Remove the debug folder from the self-contained project** and then put the
entire project in a folder named `Task1`.
