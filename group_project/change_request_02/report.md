### Table 1. Grep Search

| Concept        | Query                                | # Results | Target Class (file)                          | Tool used | Comments                                                                                                                                                              |

| Image Rotation | `rg --type cpp --ignore-case rotate` |         3 | `AdditionalTools`, `ImageArea`, `MainWindow` | ripgrep   | It appears that the actual functionality will need to be done in `additionaltools` and this functionality will propagate upwards through `imagearea` and `mainwindow` |

#### Tests Failed

#### Bugs Found

## 8. Sources

    Include any sources that you cited or used information from

## 9. Highlighted Source Code

    Attach or cut and paste the code of the classes that you changed. Highlight
    the code that was changed or added. Use YELLOW for modified code RED for
    deleted code, and GREEN for added code.

    If you only changed one method in a large file, only include that method and
    the file name itâ€™s from. Likewise, if you only changed a line or two in an
    event map or resource file, only include a few of the surrounding lines and
    the file name. Do not include thousands of lines of code that you did not
    change!
