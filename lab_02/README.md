# Lab 02 - Version Control System

**Purpose:** The purpose of this Lab is to explore how to interact with a
Version Control System such as Git. Also, explore how other version control
systems work with respect to Git.

## Task 1: Git (50 Points)

1. Download the project named “Football” from the directory A2 of Git
   repository.
2. Derive a class with your name from Offense or Defense class, e.g. class
   Macam: public Offense
3. In the main function, instance your own class, set the fields and printStats
   of your object.
4. Push your change and resolve any conflict if you get.
    - **NOTE:** This project should be built in Visual Studio 2017. Make sure it
      still builds after your pushes. Any programming task that DOES NOT COMPILE
      under Visual Studio 2017 **will receive 0**.
    - **NOTE:** DO NOT push .db (.sdf), .suo and any file in the debug folder to
      the repository. Anyone who submits those redundant files will lose at
      least 15 points.
5. Document all TortoiseGit commands that you performed for above steps.
6. Save your answers in a pdf file `FirstName_LastName_A2.pdf`.

## Task 2: Short Survey (50 Points)

There is another distributed version control system called `Mercurial`.

Write a brief report about Mercurial **in no more than two pages** in the same
document of task 1 you created above.

Clearly identify the major differences between Mercurial, Git, and Subversion
(SVN) in terms of their usage and suitability. Submit this file to canvas under
this assignment.
